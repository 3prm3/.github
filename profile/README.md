# Welcome.
To CC-orgs : An organization for [CC](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) [Mods](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched), [textures](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-overhaul) addons and possibly more!
In summary CC-orgs is an organization used to host CC (Computercraft) stuff instead of using https://github.com/cc-tweaked.
# Why the new org?
Well you see... CC Tweaked isn't the only thing on cc-tweaked (the org) so a change for a new general org name was made.
